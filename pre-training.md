Mixture Modeling for Discipline Based Education Researchers (MM4DBER) is an NSF funded training grant to support STEM Education scholars in integrating mixture modeling into their research.

</p>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 1 (August 31, 2023): Introductions, training goals, introduction to latent class analysis

Learning Outcomes:

1. Fellows will be able to create a first draft of their research goals that can be addressed with mixture modeling in the upcoming year.

2. Fellows will be able to identify how the MM4DBER training goals and opportunities can help them to apply mixture modeling training their research goals


Synchronous Activity:

* Slide deck [here]()
* [Workspace]()

Asynchronous Activity:

* Activity 1: Thoughts on articles from expert consultants (starting on slide 17 of the [Workspace]() slides)

* Activity 2: Create a draft of your research goals (starting on slide 20 of the [Workspace]() slides]

### Day 2 (September 1, 2023): ADD DESCRIPTION 

Prepartion:

- Make sure you have Mplus, R, and RStudio downloaded and ready to go!

Learning Outcomes:

1.  Using Mplus software, fellows will learn the basic skeleton of an Mplus input (*.inp*) syntax, run basic descriptive statistics, and evaluate output (*.out*)

2.  Using the `MplusAutomation` package, fellows will will be able to run descriptive statistics in R.

3.  This workshop will cover the creation of R-projects and R markdowns and discuss the benefits of organization of the R workflow.

4.  Fellows will have the opportunity to learn how to enhance and customize their R markdowns by applying themes to their documents

Synchronous Activity:

### Day 3 (September 2, 2023): ADD DESCRIPTION 

Learning Outcomes:

1.  Fellows will be able to describe principles and challenges of reproducible data science.
2.  Fellows will be able to explain tidy data principles and recognize when those principles might not apply, depending on the needs of an analysis method.
3.  Using R in RStudio, Fellows will be able to wrangle data with categorical variables, encode continuous variables to categorical, and transform data frames from wide to long format and back.

Preparation:

-   Work through the [Intro to R and R Studio tutorial](https://immerse-ucsb.github.io/intro_to_rstudio.pdf) if not already done, including installing R and R Studio.
